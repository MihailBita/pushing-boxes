# Introduction

Pushing Boxes is an ongoing project undertaken to showcase and enhance my Python programming skills, using the Pygame library. At the moment, the code is not optimal, despite it being functional. Below is an outlined roadmap of upcoming updates aimed at resolving the existing issues within the code.

# Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to run Pushing Boxes is Pygame ( pip install pygame ).

# Upcoming updates

- Implement a 'Player' and 'Cherry' class
- Add a file named 'sprites.py' and transfer the 'Player,' 'Cherry,' and 'Boxes' classes into it for better code organization
- Implement a 'Generic' sprite class so that other classes can inherit general properties
- Create a 'settings.py' file that keeps all variables that we use along coding
- Add a 'levels.py' file that switches a level after the 'Cherry' sends a "Win" statement
- Add player animations
